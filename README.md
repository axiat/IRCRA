Hi

This is the documentation of my recent program IRCRA, which stands for Intelligent Road Condition Report Application. The application implements the automatic detection of traffic violation/traffic volume and restore captured pictures in a mysql database. The program is directed by Prof. Qiang, Yang.

    To run my project, please note that the root directory is IRCRA/Proj instead of IRCRA(while importing python module)

This doc also serves as a lovely diary:)
