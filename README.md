Hi

This is the documentation of my recent program RCRA, which stands for Road Condition Report Application. The application implements the automatic detection of traffic violation/traffic volume and restore captured pictures in a mysql database. The program is directed by Prof. Qiang, Yang.

This doc also serves as a lovely diary:)
